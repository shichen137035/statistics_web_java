  "intro.ex1.title": "Restaurant example",
  "intro.p1": "You’re choosing between two restaurants on a review app. Restaurant A has 9 positives out of 10 reviews; Restaurant B has 88 positives out of 100 reviews. A’s sample proportion (0.90) looks higher than B’s (0.88).",
  "intro.p2": "But A’s sample is tiny—one or two unlucky experiences could flip the impression. B has far more data, so its estimate should fluctuate less.",
  "intro.p3": "So the real question isn’t merely “which proportion is bigger?”, but rather: how certain are we about each restaurant’s true positive rate?",
  "intro.q1": "We seek a plausible range of true ratings for each restaurant, justified by the observed data.",

  "model.title": "Modeling and Sampling Variation",
  "model.p1": "Treat each review as a Bernoulli trial. If the true positive rate is p and we observe n reviews with X positives, then",
  "model.eq.1": "$$X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p), \\quad \\hat{p}=X/n.$$",
  "model.p2": "The estimator \\(\\hat{p}\\) is unbiased and its variance depends on both p and n:",
  "model.eq.2": "$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p})=\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}.$$",
  "model.p3": "With moderate n, the Central Limit Theorem tells us",
  "model.eq.3": "$$\\frac{\\hat{p}-p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}} \\approx N(0,1).$$",
  "model.note": "Thus we can quantify how far \\(\\hat{p}\\) might wander from p by chance.",

  "wilson.title": "From Randomness to Confidence",
  "wilson.p1": "We want p values that make the standardized deviation fall within a central region of the standard normal. With 95% confidence (z=1.96):",
  "wilson.eq.1": "$$-z \\le \\frac{\\hat{p}-p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}} \\le z.$$",
  "wilson.p2": "Solving this inequality for p gives the Wilson interval:",
  "wilson.eq.2": "$$p \\in \\frac{\\hat{p} + \\tfrac{z^2}{2n} \\ \\pm\\ z \\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n} + \\tfrac{z^2}{4n^2}}}{1 + \\tfrac{z^2}{n}}.$$",
  "wilson.p3": "This method automatically stays within [0,1] and is more reliable for small n.",
