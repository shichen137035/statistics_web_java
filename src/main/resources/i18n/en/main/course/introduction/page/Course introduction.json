  "intro.p1": "This course provides a rigorous foundation in modern statistical theory, emphasizing both the mathematical principles and their practical applications. Students will learn how statistical methods are developed, analyzed, and applied in real-world research.",
  "intro.p2": "We begin with the basics of R programming, which serves as a computational platform throughout the lectures. With this foundation, students can directly implement the concepts and methods covered in the course.",
  "intro.p3": "The course then progresses through core statistical topics such as estimation, hypothesis testing, and multivariate analysis. Each lecture builds toward a deeper understanding of statistical efficiency, sufficiency, and inferential methods, providing the tools necessary for advanced research.",
