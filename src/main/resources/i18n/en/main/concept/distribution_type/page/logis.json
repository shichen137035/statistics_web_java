  "logis.section1.title": "1. Definition and Interpretation",
  "logis.section1.intro": "The Logistic distribution is a continuous distribution on $\\mathbb{R}$ with location $\\mu$ and scale $s>0$.",
  "logis.section1.intuition": "It looks similar to the Normal but has heavier tails. It is often used in logistic regression (via the logit link) and modeling growth/choice behaviors.",
  "logis.section1.scenarios": "Common scenarios include modeling latent utilities, growth curves, and as a convenient heavy-tailed alternative to the Normal.",
  "logis.section1.rel1": "When $\\mu=0$ and $s=1$, it is the standard Logistic distribution.",
  "logis.section1.rel2": "The logit function $\\text{logit}(p)=\\log\\tfrac{p}{1-p}$ maps $p\\in(0,1)$ to $\\mathbb{R}$; if $P\\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ then $X=\\mu+s\\,\\text{logit}(P)$ is Logistic$(\\mu,s)$.",
  "logis.section1.rel3": "Logistic$(\\mu,s)$ can be seen as a locationâ€“scale family generated by a standard symmetric distribution with CDF $1/(1+e^{-x})$.",

  "logis.section2.title": "2. Analytical Forms",
  "logis.section2.pdf": "PDF: $$f(x;\\mu,s)=\\frac{e^{-(x-\\mu)/s}}{s\\,[1+e^{-(x-\\mu)/s}]^{2}},\\quad x\\in\\mathbb{R},\\ s>0,$$ symmetric about $\\mu$.",
  "logis.section2.cdf": "CDF: $$F(x;\\mu,s)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(x-\\mu)/s}}.$$",
  "logis.section2.ppf": "PPF (inverse CDF): $$F^{-1}(p;\\mu,s)=\\mu+s\\,\\log\\frac{p}{1-p},\\quad 0<p<1.$$",

  "logis.section3.title": "3. Graphs",
  "logis.section3.pdfcaption": "PDF of $\\text{Logistic}(\\mu,s)$.",
  "logis.section3.cdfcaption": "CDF of $\\text{Logistic}(\\mu,s)$.",

  "logis.section4.title": "4. Additional Notes",
  "logis.section4.mean": "Expectation: $E[X]=\\mu$",
  "logis.section4.var": "Variance: $\\mathrm{Var}(X)=\\tfrac{\\pi^2}{3}s^2$",
  "logis.section4.median": "Median: $\\mathrm{med}(X)=\\mu$ (also the mode)",
  "logis.section4.skew": "Skewness: $0$ (symmetric)",
  "logis.section4.kurt": "Excess kurtosis: $1.2$ (heavier tails than Normal)",
  "logis.section4.support": "Support: $x\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$",
  "logis.section4.usage": "Used as a convenient alternative to the Normal with heavier tails; naturally arises from the logit transform of a Uniform$(0,1)$ variable.",

  "logis.section5.title": "5. Functions in R",
  "logis.section5.desc": "Common R calls for the Logistic distribution:",
  "logis.section5.code": "## PDF\ndlogis(x, location = mu, scale = s)\n\n## CDF\nplogis(x, location = mu, scale = s)\n\n## Quantile (PPF)\nqlogis(p, location = mu, scale = s)\n\n## Random generation\nrlogis(n, location = mu, scale = s)",
  "logis.section5.paramNote": "Parameters: location = mu, scale = s > 0; functions are vectorized in x (or p)."
