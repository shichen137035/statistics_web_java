## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a potential security issue or vulnerability, **please do not disclose it publicly**.

Instead, report it directly and privately to the project owner:

> 📧 security@[your-team-or-domain].org  
> or contact the project maintainer listed in the repository.

Please include:
- A brief description of the issue and its potential impact  
- The version or commit ID where it was found  
- Steps to reproduce, if applicable  

You can expect an acknowledgment within **3 business days**, and a follow-up update once the issue has been verified.

All valid reports will be handled confidentially, and appropriate patches will be issued as soon as possible.
